## Functions as objects

You can use functions as plain objects:

```javascript
var fnRef = function fnObject () {};
fnRef.someProp = 'foo';
fnRef.hello = function () {
  return 'hello';
};
```

Note that you can then access the properties and methods of this function object:

```javascript
fnRef.someProp// -> 'foo'
fnRef.hello() // -> 'hello'
```
