## Creating Functions

There are two main ways of defining functions:

- function declaration
- function expression

If a statement starts with the `function` keyword, then you have a function declaration:

`function myFn() {}`

But if you assign a function to a variable, you have a function expression:

`const fnRef = function myFn() {};`

**Note** that you need a semi colon at the end of a function expression, but there are no semi colons at the end of function declarations.

## Function Inputs and Outputs

You can pass values into and return values from a function. For example, you can make a function that takes two numbers and `returns` the result of adding them:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

If you notice, the inputs to the function are placed inside the parenthesis separated by commas. Note that `a` and `b` represent the inputs to the function. If you don't specify any return values for your function, JavaScript will return `undefined` by default:

```javascript
function fn() {
  const a = 1;
  // other stuff.
  // no return.
}
fn(); // `undefined` is returned.
```

### The `arguments` Object

Every function in JavaScript has access to the magical `arguments` object inside the function body that contains the arguments passed to a function. Let's look at a basic example to demonstrate how you can access the `arguments` object.

In this example, we are going to create a function called `sum` that is going to simply return the `arguments` object when it is called:

```javascript
function sum() {
  return arguments;
}
```

When you call the function with `sum(1,2,3)`, you can see that `arguments` is an object with three keys and values:

```javascript
{
  '0': 0,
  '1': 1,
  '2': 2
}
```
So it is important to note that the `arguments` object is not an array object. This means that `arguments` does not inherit array methods and the following returns false:

```javascript
const args = sum(1,2,3);
Object.getPrototypeOf(args) === Array.prototype; // -> false
```

As of ES2015, you can use the `Array.from` method to convert an iterable object like the `arguments` object to an array. Alternatively, you can call the `slice` method of `Array.prototype` in the context of the `arguments` object to return an array containing the values:

```javascript
const args = sum(1,2,3);
const argArray = Array.prototype.slice.call(args); // -> [1,2,3]
Object.getPrototypeOf(argArray) === Array.prototype // -> true
```


## Executing a Function

A function can be executed. This is generally known as calling a function. You can call a function by using the name of the function, followed by `()`:

```javascript
add();
```

Notice that we are calling the functions without any inputs. Let's give the function to numbers as inputs:

```javascript
add(1,2); // -> 3
```

In addition to the `()` operator, there are 3 other ways to invoke a function. That is, using:

- `call`
- `apply`
- and the `new` keyword before invoking the function with `()`

So for our simple example, let's call the function using all these methods and explore when you would want to use each method.

### `Function.prototype.call`

When you use `call` to invoke a function, the first argument is the value of the context object. And the second argument is the parameters separated by commas:

```javascript
add.call({}, 1,2); // -> 3
```

### `Function.prototype.apply`

Using `apply` is similar to `call`, except instead of passing the arguments one by one separated by commas, you pass the arguments in an array:

```javascript
add.apply({}, [1,2]); // -> 3
```


### Calling Function with `new`

**TODO**
