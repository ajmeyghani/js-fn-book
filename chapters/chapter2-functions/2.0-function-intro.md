# Functions

Functions are callable objects. It is very important to note that in JavaScript functions are objects. It might be misleading because when you use the `typeof` operator on a function, you get `function` as the output. This is one of the instances where JavaScript lies to you. The output of `typeof function () {}` should be `object` because functions are objects in JavaScript. That makes functions very powerful, because you can think of them as callable objects.
