## Setup

You can use the Chrome dev tools to interact with JavaScript. You can also install Node on your machine and interact with it in the terminal.

### Running JavaScript in Chrome DevTools

You can run JavaScript code in Chrome DevTools. You can either use the console or the snippets tab to create snippets of JavaScript code. In order to use the console, open Chrome, right click on the page, and choose inspect. Once you do that, the DevTools opens up. Once the DevTools is open, click on the `console` tab to open the Console. Once the Console tab opens, you can run JavaScript code one line at a time. The screenshot below demonstrates how to find the Console tab:
