## Book overview

In *Chapter 1* we will explore all the fundamental concepts related to functions, including function objects, function declarations and expressions, the `this` keyword and more.

In *Chapter 2* we will learn what closures are, why they are useful, and how you can use them in your programs.

In *Chapter 3* we will look at probably the most important concept in JavaScript, that is the prototypes. We will learn what they are, why they make JavaScript so different than class-oriented languages, and how you can use them to simplify the design of your programs.
