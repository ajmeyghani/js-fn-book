## How to read this book

Every chapter of the book opens with a list of bullet points of important concepts. Each bullet point is then explored in detail through the chapter. You may find the book very dry in nature, so may want to take breaks while reading. Although you may want to read chapters out of order, or just skim through the chapters, please don't. Please take your time, study each chapter slowly, and take breaks frequently if you find yourself unmotivated. The book is designed this way to serve as a reference so that you can refer to any time in the future. Also, keep in mind that the book is always up-to-date with the latest spec of the language, which is currently ES2015. I genuinely hope you get something out of the book, and please submit an issue if you don't understand something, or if you find a spelling error or a mistake in the code. The book is written in Markdown and is hosted in github: https://github.com/aminmeyghani/js-fn-book

Happy coding :)
