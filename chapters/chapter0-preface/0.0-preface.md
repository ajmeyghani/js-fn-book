# Preface

There is no doubt that JavaScript has grown to become one of the most important programming languages today. Yet, surprisingly enough, there are many who consider methodical learning of JavaScript unnecessary. This is very surprising, even so now in 2016 that JavaScript has improved dramatically since 1995 when it was first released. This trend seems to be prevalent in many venues, but it doesn't have to be that way. One of the goals of this book is to point you in the right direction by focusing on the three very important concepts in JavaScript, namely functions, closures, and prototypes. Hopefully, by the end of the book you will feel comfortable with these concepts and find yourself enabled to to go ahead and use them effectively in your own programs. In addition, there is a bonus chapter listing interview questions that are often asked in many interviews for any JavaScript or front-end related position. You can use that chapter to evaluate yourself and revisit the chapters or sections as necessary.
